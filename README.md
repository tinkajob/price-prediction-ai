# Price Prediction AI

A simple neural network project which allows you to train different models to predict house prices using different training methods.

## Features
- Predicts house prices based on features like bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft, etc.
- Targets are log-scaled for stable training
- Evolutionary algorithm with adjustable mutation strength
- Optional ReLU activation in hidden layers
- Evaluates predictions in real dollars

## Usage
1. Prepare a CSV dataset with columns:
price, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft_living, sqft_lot, floors, waterfront, view, condition, sqft_above, sqft_basement, yr_built, yr_renovated
2. Define training parameters
3. Run the training script
4. Check the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in dollars after training is done.

## Notes
- Features are normalized; target prices are log-scaled (or normalized)
- Output layer is linear; hidden layers can use ReLU
- Mutation strength can gradually decrease over generations for smoother convergence
